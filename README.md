# Robotic-arm-
The project file was developed in the visual studio. If you wish to see all code, classes, and other elements of the project's implementation please download this file. 
In this project, I have created two robotic arms, which will be used for picking up seven blocks from one location(l2) and place it on other location(l1).
Apart from placing on a location, the arms will be used to stack one block on the other.
Furthermore each robotic arm will be performing one action on one box at a time.
Moreover the robotic arms are having the grasping capacity, with which they will be performing: PICK-UP, PUT-DOWN,STACK,MOVE,UNSTACK,NOOP.
